Approaches Taken:
Search on submit rather than an debounce search as its a free plan and rate limits may be reached.

Improvement possibilty:
The auth mechanism can be implemented in a better way by creating an authGuard and then wrapping it around the app.

Chart can be implemented in a better way.


NB:
Free plan only provides data in time Interval of '1 Day' in most cases. So please choose the intervals accordingly


Instructions to run the code:

npm i 
npm run dev
